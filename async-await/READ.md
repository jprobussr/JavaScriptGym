# JavaScript Async/Await Practice

## Learning Goals

- Master `async/await` syntax.
- Understand how to handle asynchronous operations using promises.
- Progress from basic concepts to more advanced usage of async functions.

## Progress Tracker

### Beginner

- **basic-async.js**: Practiced basic `async/await` syntax and handling promises. Completed exercises on simple promise handling and error handling.

- **multiple-promises.js**: Practiced using `Promise.all()` to handle multiple promises in parallel.

- **multiple-promises-error-handling.js**: Learned how to handle individual errors for multiple asynchronous tasks.

- **fetch-api-data.js**: Fetched real-world data from two public API (JSONPlaceholder) and CEO's Dog API using `async/await` and error handling.

# JavaScript Async/Await Practice

This folder contains beginner-level exercises to practice `async/await`, API interactions, and error handling. The goal is to build a strong foundation for handling asynchronous operations in real-world scenarios.

## Beginner Exercises

### **basic-async**
- **fetch-api-data.js**: 
  - Practiced fetching data from the JSONPlaceholder API.
  - Learned error handling for failed API requests.

- **sequential-vs-parallel.js**:
  - Compared sequential and parallel execution of asynchronous tasks.
  - Observed how `Promise.all` improves efficiency in handling multiple async calls.

- **weather-dashboard.js**:
  - Built a weather dashboard that fetches geolocation data and displays temperature and wind speed.
  - Combined data from two APIs (Open-Meteo Geocoding and Weather APIs).

- **random-user-profile.js**:
  - Fetched random user data from the Random User API.
  - Extracted user details like name, email, and location.
  - Practiced creating multiple API calls in parallel to retrieve multiple profiles.

---

## Learning Highlights
- Gained hands-on experience with modern `async/await` syntax.
- Improved understanding of API interactions and real-world use cases.
- Practiced error handling to ensure robust and user-friendly applications.

---

## Next Steps
- Continue practicing real-life scenarios with beginner-friendly problems.
- Move on to **beginner error-handling.js** when ready to focus on advanced error-handling techniques.
- Gradually progress to intermediate-level exercises.

---

## Notes
- All code is written using modern JavaScript syntax (e.g., arrow functions).
- Exercises emphasize real-world applicability to prepare for actual development tasks.


### Intermediate

- (To be updated when I start intermediate exercises.)

### Advanced

- (To be updated when I start advanced exercises.)

## Notes

- Keep reviewing basic concepts before moving to the next stage.
- Aim to build a deep understanding of asynchronous operations before progressing.
